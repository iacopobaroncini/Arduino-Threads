# LightThreads

**LightThreads** library provides a simple but effective multi-threading execution environment for **Arduino** boards. Thanks to simple linguistic elements, you can quickly define a multi-threading program. The scheduling mechanism does not use any low-level feature on your microcontroller (i.e. interrupts, timers, etc), so it does not interfere with their original functionality. Thread execution is interrupted when explicitly requested or induced by the usage of synchronization mechanisms.
